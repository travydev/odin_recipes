<h2>A delicious, easy one pan lasagna recipe!</h2>
<p>This sheet pan lasagna is super rich and satisfying, filled to the brim with cheese and a healthy dose of sausage. You'll love the complexity of flavors here—just from a few aromatics, store-bought marinara, and sausage. You may find you much prefer building a lasagna on a sheet pan than in a baking dish.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 pound bulk mild Italian pork sausage</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 (32 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
<li>1/2 cup tap water</li>
<li>4 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
<li>16 ounces low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded, divided  </li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
<li>1 cup whole-milk cottage cheese  </li>
<li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
<li>1 (9 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, such as Barilla®</li>
<li>cooking spray</li>
<li>fresh basil leaves</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Place a rack in middle and upper-third positions, about 6 inches from heat source.</li>
    <li>Cook sausage in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring often and breaking into small pieces, until browned and crumbled, 6 to 8 minutes. Add onion, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. </li>
    <li>Stir in marinara sauce. Pour water into empty sauce jar, swirl to rinse, and add to the Dutch oven. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and flavors meld, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in Parmesan cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese until melted and combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Stir cream cheese, cottage cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
    <li>Spread 2 1/2 cups (about 1/3) of sauce mixture evenly on the bottom of an 18x13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Arrange half the lasagna noodles evenly over sauce, overlapping slightly and breaking noodles as needed to fit. Dollop cream cheese mixture evenly over noodles and spread into an even layer. Spoon 2 1/2 cups of the sauce mixture evenly over cream cheese mixture.</li>
    <li>Arrange remaining lasagna noodles over sauce, pressing gently into sauce so sheets lie flat. Top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella evenly over sauce.</li>
    <li>Lightly coat 1 side of 2 large pieces of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover lasagna tightly with foil, oiled side down. </li>
    <li>Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until noodles are tender and edges are bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove lasagna from oven, and discard foil. Increase oven temperature to broil. Place lasagna on rack 6 inches from heat source in oven, and broil until cheese and noodles are browned and crisp in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with basil leaves.</li>
    <li>Bon appétit!</li>
